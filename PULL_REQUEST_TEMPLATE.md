<!--- ## Anything Else?

A few things to keep in mind:

- 🌮 Let's taco-bout it. Code review is just a conversation. After you submit this please find/ping a reviewer on a separate channel and invite them to look at your PR
- 🚫 No bullies. Code review is not something senior developers do to junior developers; it's just a stage in our contribution workflow-- a checkpoint to make sure at least two people understand what is going on
- 🕴 Check your bureaucratic formalities at the .dotfile. Who cares about spaces vs. tabs, there are more serious 💡s to discuss (and 🤖 linters/style-checks to deal with the small stuff)
- 🧠 Explain your code to a human/peer:
  1. **Context**-- What is this? Why does it matter? How are you proposing to make it happen?
  2. **Validation** Does it work? How can I see that it works?
  3. **Risks** Sounds bureaucratic, but if you actually made something, you are already thinking about this. What are the gaps/missing-pieces? What are you worried about?
- 👾 This template/social-contract is defined in ./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md and edits/extensions are encouraged
